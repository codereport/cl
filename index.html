                <strong>A notation? A rephrasing of the lambda calculus? A logical theory? A theory for the foundation of
                mathematics? A computer programming language?</strong> Depending on the resource that you check you will get a
                different definition. One of the best definitions (in the author's opinion) is from the HaskellWiki:

            <blockquote style="margin: 2rem 0; padding: 1.5rem; background: #f7fafc; border-left: 4px solid #3182ce; font-style: italic; color: #2d3748;">
                "Combinatory logic was developed as a theory for the foundation of mathematics... its goal was ... to
                establish fundamental mathematical concepts on simpler and cleaner principles than the existing
                mathematical frameworks... Its 'lack of (bound) variables' relates combinatory logic to the
                pointfree style of programming."
            </blockquote>

                The best programming languages for programming with combinators are array languages like <strong>BQN</strong>, <strong>J</strong> and <strong>APL</strong>.
                Ken Iverson first introduced the S and Φ combinators as the "hook" and "fork" in the J language in the
                early 1990s. Dyalog APL would then later add combinators in Dyalog 14.0 in 2014. The newest array
                language BQN has the strongest support for combinator programming of all the array languages. More
                details of combinators as they exist in array languages can be found <a
